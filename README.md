# Healthcare PHI Secure Storage Service

This project is a HIPAA-compliant secure storage platform addressing vulnerabilities in U.S. healthcare data infrastructure. Tailored for small and mid-sized providers, it offers enterprise-grade tools for secure storage, retrieval, and management of Protected Health Information (PHI). It integrates patient consent management with real-time OTP verification and includes a tamper-proof blockchain audit trail. Built with .NET 8, Azure services, React, OpenFGA, and Keycloak, it ensures compliance with U.S. federal cybersecurity frameworks, supports digital modernization, and implements responsibility-spread key management for zero-trust decryption through multi-party collaboration.
## üìå What It Solves

- **Zero-Trust PHI Protection:** Combines AES-256 encryption, Azure Blob Storage, Key Vault, and OpenFGA to ensure that only explicitly authorized services (via JWT + policy) can access encrypted PHI mitigating ~$10B annual breach costs (Ponemon Institute, 2023).

- **Dynamic, Scalable Access Control:** Replaces rigid RBAC with OpenFGA‚Äôs fine-grained policies, enabling precise access by role and relationship (e.g., Admin: all; Nurse: Identifiers & Medical Records).

- **Seamless Interoperability:** Provides secure RESTful APIs (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) that integrate easily with EHR and telehealth systems while preserving encryption and authorization policies.

- **Responsibility-Spread Key Management:** Uses Azure Key Vault, Blob Storage, and OpenFGA to isolate encryption keys from data and enforce departmental separation requiring multi-party collaboration for decryption.

- **Affordable Data Protection-as-a-Service (DPaaS):** Deployable via Azure for ~$0.255/year per GB, saving $50K‚Äì$100K annually compared to legacy systems supporting HIPAA compliance in underserved communities.

- **Tamper-Proof Audit Trail:** Offers immutable blockchain logging via Azure Confidential Ledger, ensuring secure patient consent and unalterable record-keeping for compliance.
 

## üõ°Ô∏è Core Backend Features

- Azure Blob Storage and Key Vault for scalable, separated storage and key handling
- Azure Confidential Ledger provides immutable, tamper-evident storage for audit trails of patient consent
- OpenFGA for fine-grained access control by role and relationship
- Token-based authentication (JWT) via Keycloak
- Secure REST API endpoints tested via Swagger
- Dockerized microservice architecture for rapid deployment

## üîê AES-256 Encryption Benefits

- **Stronger Protection Against Breaches:**  AES-256 encryption is virtually uncrackable, outperforming outdated methods like SHA-1, 3DES, and AES-128 still used in legacy systems. It defends against brute-force and emerging quantum-based threats.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Meets HIPAA, HITECH, and GDPR standards for safeguarding sensitive health data.
- **End-to-End Data Security:** Ensures data at rest and in transit is encrypted, protecting against system compromise or insider threats.
- **Separation of Duties:** Keys reside in Azure Key Vault, requiring OpenFGA policy validation and token-based access for decryption.
- **Resilience in Multi-Tenant Environments:** Isolates key access per data category and role, limiting breach impact.
- **Trust & Legal Assurance:** Provides legal defensibility in audits or breach investigations, reducing financial and reputational risk.

## üìã Blockchain Audit Trail (Azure Confidential Ledger) 

- Uses **Azure Confidential Ledger** for tamper-proof, blockchain-based logging.
- Creates an **immutable audit trail** for PHI access and patient consent events.
- Leverages **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)** for confidential computing.
- Complies with **HIPAA 164.312(b)** audit control standards.
- Prevents alteration of access logs by admins, developers, or insiders.
- Enhances **zero-trust security** and legal audit defensibility.

## üè• Frontend ‚Äì PHI Secure Storage UI (React)

The PHI Secure Storage UI is a lightweight React application serving as the front-end interface for this secure backend. 
[Check Frontend](./client/README.md)

**Use Case:** A rural clinic uses this UI to manage encrypted PHI, allowing clinicians to retrieve records by category (e.g., medical history, insurance data...) while keeping access tightly controlled and auditable.

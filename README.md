# Healthcare PHI Secure Storage Service

This project is a HIPAA-aligned secure storage platform designed to address systemic vulnerabilities in U.S. healthcare data infrastructure. It provides small and mid-sized providers with enterprise-grade tools to securely store, retrieve, and manage Protected Health Information (PHI). Developed using .NET 8, Azure services, React, OpenFGA, and Keycloak, the solution reflects compliance with U.S. federal cybersecurity frameworks, supports digital modernization efforts, and introduces responsibility-spread key management to enforce zero-trust decryption via multi-party collaboration

## üìå What It Solves

- **Zero-Trust PHI Protection:** Combines AES-256 encryption, Azure Blob Storage, Key Vault, and OpenFGA to ensure that only explicitly authorized services (via JWT + policy) can access encrypted PHI mitigating ~$10B annual breach costs (Ponemon Institute, 2023).

- **Dynamic, Scalable Access Control:** Replaces rigid RBAC with OpenFGA‚Äôs fine-grained policies, enabling precise access by role and relationship (e.g., Admin: all; Nurse: Identifiers & Medical Records).

- **Seamless Interoperability:** Provides secure RESTful APIs (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) that integrate easily with EHR and telehealth systems while preserving encryption and authorization policies.

- **Responsibility-Spread Key Management:** Uses Azure Key Vault, Blob Storage, and OpenFGA to isolate encryption keys from data and enforce departmental separation requiring multi-party collaboration for decryption.

- **Affordable Data Protection-as-a-Service (DPaaS):** Deployable via Azure for ~$0.255/year per GB, saving $50K‚Äì$100K annually compared to legacy systems supporting HIPAA compliance in underserved communities.

- **Global, Centralized Governance:** Supports multi-region deployments with consistent access rules and key policies, scaling securely across health systems and jurisdictions.



## üõ°Ô∏è Core Backend Features

- Azure Blob Storage and Key Vault for scalable, separated storage and key handling
- OpenFGA for fine-grained access control by role and relationship
- Token-based authentication (JWT) via Keycloak
- Secure REST API endpoints tested via Swagger
- Dockerized microservice architecture for rapid deployment

## üîê AES-256 Encryption Benefits

- **Stronger Protection Against Breaches:**  AES-256 encryption is virtually uncrackable, outperforming outdated methods like SHA-1, 3DES, and AES-128 still used in legacy systems. It defends against brute-force and emerging quantum-based threats.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Meets HIPAA, HITECH, and GDPR standards for safeguarding sensitive health data.
- **End-to-End Data Security:** Ensures data at rest and in transit is encrypted, protecting against system compromise or insider threats.
- **Separation of Duties:** Keys reside in Azure Key Vault, requiring OpenFGA policy validation and token-based access for decryption.
- **Resilience in Multi-Tenant Environments:** Isolates key access per data category and role, limiting breach impact.
- **Trust & Legal Assurance:** Provides legal defensibility in audits or breach investigations, reducing financial and reputational risk.


## üè• Frontend ‚Äì PHI Secure Storage UI (React)

The PHI Secure Storage UI is a lightweight React application serving as the front-end interface for this secure backend. Designed with compliance and usability in mind, the UI enables:

![UI Demo](./docs/UIdemo.gif)

- Secure patient record upload and retrieval
- Role-based display and field-level encryption access
- Responsive layout optimized for tablets and desktops
- Seamless JWT authentication and OpenFGA-based authorization

**Use Case:** A rural clinic uses this UI to manage encrypted PHI, allowing clinicians to retrieve records by category (e.g., medical history, biometric data) while keeping access tightly controlled and auditable.

## About the Author

This solution was developed by Ahmad Rami El Tal, a Senior Software Engineer with expertise in regulated environments, cloud security, and telehealth platforms. It is based on real world implementations and aims to reduce the $10B+ annual impact of healthcare data breaches in the U.S. As an active HIMSS Digital Member (joined 2025), I am refining this solution for potential presentation at HIMSS26, with a focus on scalable PHI security tailored for underserved healthcare providers.

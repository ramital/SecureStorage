# Patient Management System

The PHI Secure Storage UI a lightweight React front-end designed to interact with the SecureStorage API for managing encrypted healthcare data. It enables healthcare admins or authorized users to upload, retrieve, and decrypt patient-related records securely through a user-friendly interface.

🔐 Built with compliance in mind, the UI enforces access control (e.g., via JWT and OpenFGA), supports multi-tenant environments, and integrates seamlessly with backend services like Azure Blob Storage and Key Vault.

🏥 Use Case: A small clinic can use this UI to manage encrypted ePHI files without needing complex IT infrastructure—enabling secure patient data workflows in line with HIPAA guidelines.
